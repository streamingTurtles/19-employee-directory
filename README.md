  ## Project Description:
  - This is an React application running on gitHub pages that renders an employee directory from the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/) website. The app renders random users from which you can search via first and last name.  The app can also sort the employee list in either ascending or descending order about the first or last names.  When the page is refreshed, the app recycles the apiSearch with a new random employee list.  The app also implements updating yearly to the currnent Year, as represented in the footer.  The application runs locally on localhost as well as on github pages. Example screenshots are shown.
